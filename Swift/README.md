This project is to experiment with Swift user interface code that can be shared by iOS and OS X projects.  

It reimplements some ViewControllers from Apple's UICatalog sample code in a platform-independent way that can be used in either iOS or OS X projects.

There is no subclassing, no swizzing -- just native iOS and OS X classes accessed via type aliases and some extensions.  

Michael Patrick Ellard and Mike Mehr are the development team for this project. 

The components of this project were created by:
